VLF-EM Signal Anomaly Detection using EEMD
This project demonstrates how to simulate and analyze a Very Low Frequency Electromagnetic (VLF-EM) signal using Empirical Ensemble Mode Decomposition (EEMD) to detect anomalies ‚Äî such as mineral deposits or resource irregularities ‚Äî along a survey line.

Overview
This process applies to geophysical exploration problems where VLF-EM data is used to detect subsurface conductive anomalies. By decomposing a signal into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EEMD, we can isolate and identify outliers that may indicate:

Conductive ore bodies

Water tables

Structural disruptions (faults/fractures)

Equipment or survey errors

Features
Synthetic VLF-EM signal generator

EEMD decomposition using PyEMD

IMF visualization

Signal reconstruction & noise filtering

Anomaly detection using residual thresholding

This will:

Simulate a VLF-EM signal with an embedded deposit anomaly.

Apply EEMD decomposition.

Reconstruct the denoised signal.

Highlight anomalies in the residual signal.

How It Works
Simulate a geophysical line profile with:

Natural geologic background (sinusoid)

Gaussian anomaly (deposit)

Random noise

Decompose signal using EEMD into multiple IMFs:

IMF1 = high-frequency noise

IMF2‚Äìn = structure, trend

Reconstruct the denoised signal by summing IMF2 and onward.

Detect anomalies by thresholding the residual (original - reconstructed).

Applications
Mineral exploration

Environmental surveys

Infrastructure planning

Subsurface anomaly mapping
